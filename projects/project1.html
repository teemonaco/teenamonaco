                            The high-traffic e-commerce platform, catering primarily to women aged 55+, had not
                            undergone a redesign in nearly 20 years. The outdated design failed to meet WCAG AA
                            accessibility guidelines, which were crucial for the core demographic. Additionally, the
                            site was not responsive, and research surfaced the importance of mobile-friendly updates for
                            improving user engagement and accessibility.</p>
                        <p class="about-me-text">
                            We introduced Pay in 4 with PayPal and Apple Pay to streamline the checkout flow, aiming for
                            a faster, more efficient user experience that aligned with modern payment preferences.

                <h2 class="mb-4">Research Insights and Data-Driven Decisions</h2>
                <p>Throughout the checkout redesign process, I utilized tools like GA4 and Matomo to gather and analyze
                    data on user behavior. The insights helped pinpoint major friction points and areas for improvement,
                    particularly regarding abandonment rates and anomalies detected across the checkout flow.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">This prompted a deeper investigation into specific page-level performance, with a focus
                    on understanding why users were abandoning their carts at such high rates during key stages like
                    shipping, billing, and confirmation.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-2">
                        <div class="impactful-stats card">
                            <h5>Anomallies Detected</h5>
                            <img src="../images/redesign-chart-2.svg" alt="57% of Users" class="img-fluid">
                            <p>The graph shows a significant spike in cart errors, which are events we track through
                                GA4. However, the error patterns were inconsistent and didn't align with specific
                                events, such as days when we stream live videos or experience high traffic. This raised
                                questions about device and browser compatibility, particularly considering our core
                                demographic of women aged 55+. I also considered the possibility of issues with
                                accessibility, unclear language or instructions, and potential flaws in the user
                                journey. This led me to question whether we were using best practices for accessibility
                                and usability, especially without a formal framework in place.</p>

                            <h5>Abandonment Rate by Page</h5>
                            <img src="../images/redesign-chart-3.svg" alt="57% of Users" class="img-fluid">
                            <p>To further investigate where users were facing challenges, I examined the abandonment
                                rate by page. This bar graph highlights that the most significant drop-offs occurred
                                during the "My Cart" and "Billing" stages of the checkout process, on both mobile and
                                desktop. With this information, I prioritized these two pages for improvements, as they
                                represented the most crucial friction points in the checkout journey. Addressing these
                                could have a major impact on reducing cart abandonment and improving overall conversion
                                rates.</p>

                                appeal, resulting in missed opportunities for users to continue shopping.</p>
